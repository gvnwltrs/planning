## Idea
1. Hello World with vanilla js 
  - graphical stuff that starts with a big letter H presented to the user
  - the user can hit the up key or scroll the mouse to pass underneath each letter 
  - once the user reach the end, the entire hello world is presented on the screen in bouncy/floaty display 
  - if the user its the down arrow or scrolls back the hello world display will starting working in reverse taking the user all the way back to H
